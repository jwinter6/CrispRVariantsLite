### Define the guide sequence
We need to define the guide and the area around that we want to summarize the mutation spectrum over.

You will need the coordinate of your sequence, the size of the area around the guide, the orientation of the strand, the name of the chromosome and the genome to the mapping. **CrispRVariantsLite** will automatically create a sequence of 20pb extended by the size defined by the user.
